LimitedObjectScrollList Package

This package allows the user to display very long lists, without using many more scene objects than the viewport requires.

The primary code for this package is provided in the form of generic classes that the user may use for custom UI.

It also contains some concrete templates that can be used as examples for deriving custom versions.

PreFab objects, using these template classes, provide immidiate access to a working versions of readOnly and input text lists.
